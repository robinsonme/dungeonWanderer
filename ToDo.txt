ToDo
1.) Use a BS modal button to launch a create character window. On the character page if no character is found then have the create character modal launch.
2.) Determine if I want to do a Dragon Tavern Type game, idle type game, or a deeper RPG type game.
3.) Honestly could combine all three types together. Dragon and deep RPG would be easy. Adding the idle elements would need to make sure were extremely slow growth idle.
4.) Create a DB for characters.
5.) Create a DB for stats. Needs to have a createdBy CharacterID not just UserID.
6.) Create a DB for equipment. Needs an equipped variable and a slot variable. Needs to have a createdBy CharacterID not just UserID.
